title: "Alternatives to the T-Tools"
---

## Objectives
- Identify when analysis methods based on the t-tools are inappropriate for a dataset.
- Understand the principles behind rank-sum, signed-rank, and permutation tests.
- Learn how to appropriately apply and interpret rank-sum, signed-rank, and permutation tests.


## Nonparametric Methods
- Nonparametric methods provide a solution when assumptions of the t-test cannot be met, such as:
  - Severe skewness in data.
  - Large differences in variances between samples.
  - Small sample sizes that preclude assumptions about the population.


## Censored Data
- Censored data occurs when the exact value of an observation is unknown, often due to exceeding a measurement limit (e.g. students taking longer than the maximum allowed time to complete a test).
- Rank-based tests, such as the rank-sum test, rely on rank information, making them robust to censored observations.


## Permutation Test
- A permutation test serves as a nonparametric alternative to the two-sample t-test, as it does not assume normality.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The null hypothesis is true, and random shuffling of data is consistent with it.
  - The null distribution is built through repeated permutations of the data.
- **Procedure**:
  1. Combine $n + m$ observations from the two treatments.
  2. Permute these observations randomly between the treatments.
  3. Compute the test statistic (e.g., mean, median, or ratio) for each permutation.
  4. Compare the observed test statistic to the distribution of permuted test statistics.
- **Applications**:
  - Ideal for non-normal data or datasets with ties (e.g. the Challenger O-ring study).
  - Useful for a wide variety of parameters (e.g. mean, median, ratio).
  - Not suitable when observations have an inherent order.


## Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test
- **Purpose**:
  - A distribution-free method for comparing two independent samples.
  - Particularly useful for small sample sizes, where normality assumptions cannot be assessed.
  - Resistant to outliers and capable of handling censored observations.
- **Hypothesis**:
  - $H_0$: The medians of the two groups are equal.
- **Procedure**:
  1. Combine observations from both groups and rank them:
     - Ties are assigned the average rank.
  2. Calculate the test statistic:
     - The sum of ranks for one group (conventionally the smaller group for ease of computation).
  3. Compute the p-value:
     - **Exact Method**:
       - Evaluate all permutations of ranks to generate the distribution of all possible rank sums.
       - Calculate the proportion of rank sums for a group greater than or equal to the observed rank sum (e.g., the number of rank sums greater than or equal to the observed value divided by the total number of permutations).  
       - This is equivalent to a permutation test on the rank sum statistic rather than the difference of means.
       - **Limitation**: Computationally impractical for large sample sizes.
     - **Normal Approximation**:
       - The rank sum statistic approximates a normal distribution for larger sample sizes, especially with few ties.
       - Apply a continuity correction to adjust for the discrete nature of rank sums:
         - For a left-sided test, add a small adjustment.
         - For a right-sided test, subtract a small adjustment.
- **Confidence Intervals**:
  - Use Hodges-Lehmann estimation.
- **Notes**:
  - Continuity correction adjusts for the discrete nature of rank sums by approximating their area (represented as bars) with the area under a continuous curve (e.g. the normal distribution), improving the accuracy of p-value calculations.


## Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test: Normal Approximation with Continuity Correction
![](images/display_4_6.png)  
![](images/display_continuityCorrection.png)  
- Z =  (𝑇 −𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝑇))/(𝑆𝐷(𝑇))
- T – rank sum statistic, the sum of ranks for one of the groups.
- R-bar – average of all the ranks (both groups)
- sR – standard deviations of all the ranks (both groups)
- Mean(T) and SD(T) – the theoretical (null hypothesis) mean and standard deviation of one group
- p-value – proportion of values from a standard normal distribution that are more extreme than the observed Z-statistic.

## Alternatives to the paired t-test
- Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test - alternative to a paired t-test
  - Null hypothesis: the mean difference is equal.
  - For a one-sided test, be careful of the direction of the test, the sign of the difference.
  - Compute difference in each pair.
  - Ranks are done in absolute value.
  - The signed-rank statistic is the sum of the positive ranks (all ranks from positive differences).
  - Also, can do an exact test or a normal approximation.
    - Normal:
      - Mean(S) = n(n+1)/4
      - SD(S) = sqrt[n(n+1)(2n+1)/24]
      - Z-statistic = S – Mean(S) / SD(S)
      - Lookup p-value (software, z-table)
  - Resistant to outliers but maintains relative magnitude of the differences (unlike the sign test).

## Code Examples: Signed-Rank and Sign Tests

SAS code:
```{sas eval=FALSE}
/* Sign Test and Signed Rank Test */

/* paired density of nerve cell count
between 2 sites in each horse's intestine */

data horse;
input horse site1 site2;
datalines;
6 14.2 16.4
4 17 19
8 37.4 37.6
5 11.2 6.6
7 24.2 14.4
9 35.2 24.4
3 35.2 23.2
1 50.6 38
2 39.2 18.6
;

proc print data = horse;
run;

* paired t-test;
/* normality might be suspect because 
sample size is small */
proc ttest data = horse;
paired site1*site2;
run;

/* H0: median difference between site1 and site2 is zero
Ha: median difference not zero (2-sided)
or median difference between site1 and site2 >0 (1-sided) */
* signed rank test (sign and magnitude of differences);

* copy the dataset and make a diff column;
data horse2;
set horse;
diff = site1 - site2;
run;

* look at the new dataset;
proc print data = horse2;
run;

/* proc univariate does a paired t-test,
a sign test and a signed rank test by default */
proc univariate data = horse2;
var diff;
run;


/* Conclusion: There is strong evidence that the median difference of nerve density between site 1 and site 2 is greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, one-sided p-value of 0.0294.) In other words, there is strong evidence to suggest that the median density of nerve cells is greater at site 1 than site 2. */

```

R code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wilcox.test(horse$site1, horse$site2, paired = true)

```

## Alternatives to the paired t-test and F-test
- Sign Test - alternative to a paired t-test
  - Tests for median difference
  - Very simple, just the number of positive values after taking the differences between paired observations (K).
  - Null hypothesis: K = n/2
  - Find the difference between the paired values and record the sign.
  - Normal approximation to the binomial distribution:
    - Z =  (K – 0.5 – n/2) / sqrt(n/4)
    - Observed (w. continuity correction) – expected / st. dev.
    - Where K is the observed positives, 0.5 is continuity correction, n/2 is half of the observations = our expected number of positives, over the standard deviation
    - Don’t know why st. dev. is over 4?
  - Not a powerful test, so unlikely to detect a difference.
- Levene’s (Median) Test of Equal Spread - alternative to the F-test (visual test still best)
  - Useful for non-normal distributions.
  - H0: the distributions have the same spread, HA: different spread
  - Takes absolute value of each observation minus median and does a two-sample t-test on those values  for each group.
  - F-test looks at the variance.
  - In SAS, called Brown Forsythe Test -> proc glm.
  - In SAS, Levene’s test is the abs diff of the obs from the mean of its group. This can also be called in proc glm.

SAS code:
```{sas eval = FALSE}
/* Test Prep Example */
data exam;
input score type $;
datalines;
37 New

model score = type;
means type / hovtest = bf; *hov = homogeneity of variance bf = brown forsythe;
run;
