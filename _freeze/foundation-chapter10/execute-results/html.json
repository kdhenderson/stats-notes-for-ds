Violations can lead to underestimated standard errors, which inflate *t*-statistics and make it easier to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\n- **Remedy**: Serial and cluster effects require different models.\n\n### How Much Deviation Is Acceptable?\n- Small violations of assumptions generally do not invalidate regression results.\n- However, large deviations can lead to inaccurate estimates, especially for standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values.\n- Transformations can often correct violations and improve interpretability.\n- Only severe departures from linearity or normality (e.g., due to outliers) typically require alternative methods.\n\n\n## Influential and Outlying Observations\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Influential observations**: These are points that, if added or removed, substantially change the regression line (e.g., the slope or intercept).\n- **Leverage**: A measure of how far an observation’s $x$ value is from the mean of all $x$ values ($\\bar{x}$).\n  - Points farther from $\\bar{x}$ have higher leverage.\n  - Mathematically, leverage increases with the squared distance from $x_i$ to $\\bar{x}$, relative to the total sum of squares in $x$. This is closely related to how many standard deviations $x_i$ is from the mean.\n  - Leverage is based on the $x$ values alone; it does *not* depend on $y$.\n\n### Impact of Outliers\n- **Low leverage, low influence**: Minimal effect on estimates.\n- **High leverage, low influence**: Far from most data but consistent with the trend; minimal effect on the correlation, standard errors, and regression estimates.\n- **High leverage, high influence**: Can distort results by pulling the regression line toward the outlier, resulting in different parameter estimates.\n\n### Detecting Influential Observations\n\n#### Leverage Statistic, $h_{ii}$\n- Measures how far the $x$ value for an observation is from the mean $\\bar{x}$, in relation to the total spread of $x$ values. Larger values of $h_{ii}$ indicate higher leverage.\n- An observation is considered to have high leverage if $h_{ii} > \\dfrac{2p}{n}$, where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model (including the intercept).\n- Formula:\n  $$\n  h_{ii} = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (X_j - \\bar{X})^2}\n  $$\n  or\n  $$\n  h_{ii} = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\left[ \\frac{(X_i - \\bar{X})}{s_x} \\right]^2 + \\frac{1}{n}\n  $$\n\n\n## Types of Residuals\n- **Standardized:** $e_i / \\text{RMSE}$\n- **Studentized:** $e_i / \\sqrt{\\text{MSE} \\cdot (1 - h_{ii})}$\n- **Studentized-deleted (R-student):**\n  - Remove an observation, recalculate the regression, and compute the studentized residual.\n  - The standard deviation is calculated without the point in question.\n  - Large residual values indicate potentially influential points.\n  - Formula:\n    $$\n    \\text{RSTUDENT} = \\frac{\\text{res}_i}{s_i \\sqrt{1 - h_i}}\n    $$\n- **Why different types?** All three aim to stabilize variance so that residuals are comparable, but they differ in how they estimate the error term:\n  - **Standardized:** Uses a single overall RMSE.\n  - **Studentized:** Adjusts for leverage via $(1 - h_{ii})$.\n  - **R-student:** Recalculates without the observation for more accurate influence detection.\n\n\n## Leave-One-Out Statistics\n\nThese measures assess the impact of each observation by considering the model fit when that observation is omitted.\n\nLet $\\hat{Y}_{i(i)}$ be the predicted value of $Y_i$ when the $i$-th observation is left out of the regression model.\n\n### PRESS (Predicted Residual Sum of Squares)\n$$\n\\text{PRESS}_p = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_{i(i)}\\right)^2 = \\sum e_{i(i)}^2\n$$\n\n- Smaller PRESS values indicate better-fitting models.\n\n### Cook’s Distance ($D_i$)\n- Combines information on residual size and leverage, and is equivalent to comparing predictions from the full model to those from a leave-one-out model:\n$$\nD_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\left(\\hat{Y}_{i(i)} - \\hat{Y}_i\\right)^2}{p \\cdot \\text{MSE}} = \\frac{1}{p} (\\text{studres}_i)^2 \\left[\\frac{h_i}{1 - h_i}\\right]\n$$\n- Here, $p$ is the number of parameters in the model (including the intercept).\n\n\n## Durbin-Watson Test for Independence\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (e_i - e_{i-1})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}\n$$\n\n- Values near 0 indicate positive correlation; values near 4 indicate negative correlation. The distribution is symmetric about 2.\n- Available in R and SAS.\n\n\n## Residual Types Summary\n\n| **Name**                  | **Expression**                                           | **Use**                        |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Residual**              | $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$                                   | Residual plots                 |\n| **Standardized residual** | $r_i = \\frac{e_i}{s \\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}}$                   | Identify outliers              |\n| **Studentized residual**  | $t_i = \\frac{e_i}{s_{(i)} \\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}}$             | Test outlying $Y$ values       |\n| **Deleted residual**      | $e_{i(i)} = y_i - \\hat{y}_{i(i)} = \\frac{e_i}{1 - h_{ii}}$ | Calculate PRESS                |\n\n> For studentized residuals, at $\\alpha = 0.05$ we expect about 5% to be greater than 2 or less than –2.\n\n\n## Residual Diagnostics Panel\n\n![**Residual diagnostics panel.** A collection of plots used to assess regression assumptions and identify potential problems. Several plots use standardized, studentized, or studentized-deleted (R-student) residuals to improve comparability across observations. These include: residuals vs. predicted values (checking for nonlinearity or heteroscedasticity), R-studentized residuals vs. predicted values (highlighting outliers), and R-studentized residuals vs. leverage (identifying high-leverage outliers). Other diagnostics include the normal QQ plot and histogram of residuals (assessing normality), predicted values vs. observed values (evaluating fit), Cook’s distance by observation (identifying influential points by combining leverage and residual size), and QQ plots of fitted means and residuals. Together, these diagnostics help evaluate model adequacy and guide possible remedies.](images/fch10_residualPanel.png)\n\n\n## Graphical Assessment of Residuals\n\n| **Pattern**                    | **Potential Issue**        | **Solution**                  |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Linear means, constant SD      | Model fits well            | No action needed              |\n| Curved means, equal SD         | Nonlinearity               | Transform $X$                 |\n| Curved means, increasing SD    | Nonlinearity + heteroscedasticity | Transform $Y$        |\n| Skewed residuals               | Non-normality              | Can still model the mean, but CIs/PIs may be unreliable. Consider transformations. |\n| Linear means, increasing SD    | Heteroscedasticity         | Use weighted regression       |\n\n\n## Remedies for Violations\n\n### Nonlinearity\n- Add more complexity to the model.\n- Apply a transformation to $X$.\n- Add another variable, which may also help nonconstant variance.\n\n### Nonconstant Variance\n- Transform $Y$.\n- Use weighted least squares to down-weight observations with larger variance so they don’t influence the regression model as much as observations closer to the line.\n\n### Correlated Errors\n- Often detected via residual plots, where you may see small values follow small values, and large follow large.\n- Use time series or spatial models for serial effects within data.\n\n### Outliers\n- Use robust regression.\n- Check for data entry or other errors. Only delect observations in this situation.\n\n### Non-normality\n- Usually fixed via the above methods, so wait to fix until last.\n- Consider transforming the data.\n\n\n## Residual Patterns and Suggested Remedies\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_a.png){fig-title=\"(a) Check distribution of $Y$ at different $X$ values\"}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_b.png){fig-title=\"(b) Curvature $\\rightarrow$ Consider transforming $X$\"}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_c.png){fig-title=\"(c) Quadratic trend $\\rightarrow$ Add $X^2$\"}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_d.png){fig-title=\"(d) Fan-shaped spread $\\rightarrow$ Transform $Y$\"}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_e.png){fig-title=\"(e) Skewed residuals $\\rightarrow$ Report skewness\"}\n\n![](images/fch10_residuals_f.png){fig-title=\"(f) Spread depends on $X$ $\\rightarrow$ Weighted regression\"}\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"figure-caption\">\n<strong>Residual patterns to watch for.</strong> Each panel shows a scatter with bin-wise means and standard deviations (dark line and bars).

Log transformation\n2. Square root transformation\n3. Other transformations (e.g., reciprocal)\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n![](images/fch10_YTransforms_log.png)\n\n![](images/fch10_YTransforms_sqrt.png)\n\n![](images/fch10_YTransforms_reciprocal.png)\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"figure-caption\">\n<strong>Examples of variance-stabilizing transformations.</strong> When the spread of residuals changes with fitted values, transforming the response variable $Y$ can help stabilize variance. The panels illustrate three common recommendations: (a) a log transformation for decreasing variance, (b) a square root transformation for increasing variance, and (c) a reciprocal transformation for variance proportional to the mean. These transformations change the interpretation of model coefficients, and results may need to be back-transformed for reporting.\n</div>\n\n### Interpretation Considerations\n- Adjust interpretation to the audience, transformation type, and variables transformed.\n- Back-transform results when necessary.\n\n\n## Log Transformations: Types and Interpretations\n\nLog transformations can be highly effective and may yield more interpretable regression results.  \nThe three most common forms are log-linear, linear-log, and log-log models.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n### Useful Properties for Log Transformations\n1.
