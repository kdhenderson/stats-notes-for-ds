## Scatterplots

Scatterplots visually represent the relationship between two quantitative variables, illustrating how they vary together. Key points:

- The **explanatory variable ($X$)** is plotted on the X-axis, while the **response variable ($Y$)** is on the Y-axis.
- Each dot represents an observation.
- Patterns to look for include:
  - Positive or negative linear relationships
  - Curved patterns (e.g., parabolic)
  - Logarithmic or sinusoidal relationships
  - Random scatter (no clear relationship)


## Interpreting Correlations

### Square of Correlation Coefficient ($r^2$)
- Represents shared variance. Example: $r = 0.8$ implies $r^2 = 0.64$, meaning 64% of variability in $Y$ is explained by its linear relationship with $X$.

### Significance
- When $r = 1$, there is a perfect positive linear relationship.
- When $r = -1$, there is a perfect negative linear relationship.
- When $r = 0$, there is no linear relationship.

### Key Notes
- The sign of $r$ indicates the direction of the slope (positive or negative):
  - A negative correlation reflects an inverse relationship.
  - Positive and negative correlations of the same magnitude have the same shared variance.
- Changing sample size does not affect $r$.
- Correlation does not imply causation.


## Correlation Analysis

### Key Formula
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{(n-1) S_x S_y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Z_x Z_y}{n-1}
$$
Where $n$ = number of $(x, y)$ pairs.

### Why Plot the Data First?
- Use scatterplots to visually check for linear relationships, outliers, or curved patterns (e.g., Anscombe's dataset). Then calculate the correlation to assess the strength of the relationship.
- Outliers can significantly distort $r$, regression slopes, and intercepts, as these measures are not resistant to extreme values.


## Factors Affecting the Magnitude of $r$

- **Bivariate Outliers**: Can inflate or deflate $r$.
- **Distribution Shape**: Differences in variability between $X$ and $Y$ can distort $r$.
- **Range Restrictions**: Restricted ranges of data can misrepresent $r$.
- **Combining Groups**: Mixed groups may lead to misleading correlations. Averages are less variable, so the correlation will be stronger.


## Facts About $r$

- $r$ estimates the population correlation, $\rho$.
- Measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.
- Always between $-1$ and $1$.
- Unitless; unaffected by changes in measurement scales.
- Assumes both variables are quantitative.
- Assumes bivariate normal distribution (for any value of $y$, $x$ has a normal distribution, and vice versa).
- Not resistant to outliers.


## Interpreting $r^2$, the Coefficient of Determination

### Definition

$r^2$, also known as the *coefficient of determination*, represents the proportion of variability in $Y$ that is explained by its linear relationship with $X$.

If $r^2$ is calculated from a sample, it serves as an estimate of how well changes in $X$ explain variation in $Y$.

For example, an $r^2$ of 0.75 means that 75% of the variability in $Y$ can be attributed to its linear relationship with $X$, while the remaining 25% remains unexplained by the model.

### Formula
$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
$$
Where:

- $SS_{\text{res}}$ = sum of squared residuals
- $SS_{\text{tot}}$ = total sum of squares

This measures how much of the total variance from the equal means model is explained by the regression model.


## Correlation Doesn’t Equal Causation

- Association (strong correlation) is not causation.
- The only way to make cause-and-effect statements is with a randomized experiment.


## Keys to Remember

- The correlation coefficient assumes **equal standard deviation**:
  - Don’t confuse fewer data points with smaller standard deviation.
- The range of the data is a proxy for the spread. Knowing the particular $X$ value reduces the variation.


## Data Exploration

- Always plot the data using scatterplots for two quantitative variables.
- Look for overall patterns: positive/negative, strong/weak, curved/linear.
- If the relationship is linear, calculate a numerical summary.
- Plot a regression line for interpretation.


## Least Squares Regression

### Origin of Regression
- The term **regression** originates from Francis Galton’s phrase "Regression toward mediocrity," referring to regression to the mean.
- A regression line is a straight line that describes how a **response variable ($Y$)** changes as an **explanatory variable ($X$)** changes. It is used to predict the value of $Y$ for a given $X$.

### Key Points
1. **One Best-Fit Line**: 
   - There is only one best-fit line per dataset.
   - This line minimizes the distance between observed points and the line (residuals).
   - **Residuals**: The difference between the observed value ($y_i$) and the predicted value ($\hat{y}_i$), calculated as $\text{Residual} = y_i - \hat{y}_i$. Residuals measure the error in prediction.
   - The best-fit line (slope and y-intercept) minimizes the **sum of squared residuals (SSR)**.
   - All the residuals would be zero for a perfect fitting line.

2. **Relation to Correlation**:
   - $\hat{b_1}$ (slope) and $r$ always have the same sign.
   - The least squares regression line always passes through $(\bar{X}, \bar{Y})$.

3. **Choice of Variables**:
   - Regression equation depends on the designation of explanatory and response variables.
   - **With correlation**, you can flip $X$ and $Y$, but not with regression.

4. **Subpopulations**:
   - In simple regression with a single explanatory variable, each value of the explanatory variable corresponds to a subpopulation of responses.
   - Regression describes the relationship between the means of these subpopulations and the explanatory variable.

### Estimating Regression Coefficients
1. **Slope ($\hat{\beta}_1$)**:
   $$
   \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2} = r \frac{S_y}{S_x}
   $$
2. **Intercept ($\hat{\beta}_0$)**:
   $$
   \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{X}
   $$

### Definition
A regression line predicts $Y$ from $X$:
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$

### Interpretation
1. **Slope ($\hat{\beta}_1$)**, coefficient of $X$:
   - Represents the predicted change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$.
   - "Rise over run": $\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$
   - Each one-unit increase in $X$ is associated with an estimated increase of $\beta_1$ units in the predicted value of $Y$.
   - Example: A slope of $6.708$ means a one-hour increase in study time predicts an average score increase of 6.708 points.
2. **Intercept ($\hat{\beta}_0$)**, constant term:
   - Represents the predicted value of $Y$ when $X = 0$.
   - Example: An intercept of $40.993$ means a predicted score of 40.993 when no study time is recorded.

### Extrapolation
- Predictions are only valid for $X$ values within the range used to build the model.
- **Extrapolation**: Predicting values of $Y$ for $X$ outside the observed data range. Use cautiously, as extrapolated predictions may not reliably represent real-world behavior and clearly communicate that the results are extrapolated.

### Assumptions for Linear Regression
1. **Normality**, conditional on $X$:
   - The response variable is normally distributed for each value of $X$.
2. **Linearity**:
   - The relationship between the means of $Y$ for each value of $X$ is linear. The mean of the normal distributions follow a linear pattern.
3. **Equal Standard Deviation**:
   - Variance of residuals is constant for all $X$.
   - Estimate: $\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{residuals}_i^2}{n - 2}} = \text{RMSE}$.
4. **Independence**:
   - Observations are independent of each other.

### Notation
- $m_{Y|X} = b_0 + b_1X$: Mean of $Y$ as a function of $X$ or for a specific value of $X$.
- $s_{Y|X} = s$: Standard deviation of $Y$ as a function of $X$, assuming equal standard deviation across $X$ values.

### Hand-Calculated Pearson’s $r$
We can calculate the sample linear correlation coefficient, $r$, using either of the following equivalent formulas:
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{(n - 1) S_X S_Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Z_{X_i} Z_{Y_i}}{n - 1}
$$
Where:

- $Z_{X_i} = \dfrac{X_i - \bar{X}}{S_X}$
- $Z_{Y_i} = \dfrac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{S_Y}$

#### Example: Calculating $Z$-scores
To compute $Z_{X}$ for the first observation:
$$
Z_{X_1} = \frac{1 - 3.923}{2.397} = -1.220
$$

To compute $Z_{Y}$ for the first observation:
$$
Z_{Y_1} = \frac{34 - 67.308}{19.564} = -0.578
$$

### Raw Data and Z-Scores
| Hours ($X$) | Score ($Y$) | $Z_X$  | $Z_Y$  | $Z_X Z_Y$ |
|------------|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1          | 34          | -1.220 | -1.7703| 2.077     |
| 1          | 56          | -1.220 | -0.578 | 0.705     |
| 2          | 45          | -0.802 | -1.140 | 0.915     |
| 2          | 70          | -0.802 |  0.138 | -0.110    |
| 2          | 55          | -0.802 | -0.624 | 0.305     |
| 3          | 68          | -0.385 |  0.035 | -0.014    |
| 4          | 67          |  0.032 | -0.016 | -0.001    |
| 4          | 79          |  0.032 |  0.598 | 0.019     |
| 4          | 45          |  0.032 | -1.140 | -0.037    |
| 6          | 89          |  0.862 |  1.109 | 0.956     |
| 7          | 95          |  1.284 |  1.416 | 1.817     |
| 7          | 78          |  1.284 |  0.547 | 0.702     |
| 8          | 94          |  1.701 |  1.364 | 2.321     |

**Summary statistics**:

- $\bar{X} = 3.923$, $S_X = 2.397$
- $\bar{Y} = 67.308$, $S_Y = 19.564$
- $n = 13$
- $\sum Z_X Z_Y = 9.86036$

### Final Computation of $r$
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{13} Z_{X_i} Z_{Y_i}}{13 - 1} = \frac{9.86036}{12} = 0.8217
$$

Therefore, the sample correlation is: $r = 0.8217$

### Scatterplot of Test Score by Study Hours
After plotting the data, we do not see evidence of:

- Outliers
- Unequal standard deviations
- A curved relationship

Since a linear relationship appears appropriate, we proceed with correlation analysis.

The correlation coefficient is: $r = 0.8217$

This value provides evidence of a strong positive linear association between study hours and test score.

## Pearson’s $r$ and the Six-Step Hypothesis Test

### 1. Hypotheses (Testing $\rho$, the Population Correlation Coefficient)
- $H_0$: $\rho = 0$ (no linear correlation in the population)
- $H_A$: $\rho \ne 0$ (a linear correlation exists in the population)

### 2. Critical Value (From a *t*-Distribution)
- $\pm t_{0.975, 13 - 2} = \pm 2.201$

#### Computing the critical value:
- In SAS: `quantile("t", 0.975, 13 - 2)`
- In R: `qt(0.975, 11)`

### 3. Test Statistic
The sample linear correlation coefficient $r$ is transformed into a *t*-distribution using the formula:
$$
t = \frac{r\sqrt{n - 2}}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}} \sim t_{n - 2}
$$

#### Substituting values:
$$
t = \frac{0.8217 \cdot \sqrt{13 - 2}}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8217)^2}} = 4.718
$$

### Compute $r$ in Statistical Software

#### In SAS:
```{sas eval=FALSE}
proc corr data = Studytime;
run;
```

#### In R:
```{r eval=FALSE}
cor.test(StudyTime$StudyHours, StudyTime$ExamScore)
```

<strong>Outputs from SAS and R showing the Pearson correlation between study time and exam score.</strong> SAS includes descriptive statistics, $r = 0.8217$, and a *p*-value. R includes the $t$-statistic, degrees of freedom, confidence interval, estimate ($r = 0.8217$), and *p*-value for $H_0: \rho = 0$.
</div>

### 4. Find the *p*-Value
The *p*-value is calculated using the *t*-distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom.

- In this example, the *p*-value is 0.0006.

### 5. Decision
At a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$:

- Since $p = 0.0006 < 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.

### 6. Conclusion
At the $\alpha = 0.05$ level, there is strong evidence that exam scores are linearly correlated with study hours (*p*-value = 0.0006).

- Since the correlation is statistically significant, it makes sense to interpret $R^2$.
- It is estimated that $R^2 = 67.5\%$ of the variation in exam scores is explained by study hours.

**Scope**:  
Because students were not randomly assigned study hours, we cannot conclude causation, only association. Also, since the data collection method is unknown, we cannot generalize this result beyond the students in the study.

### Least Squares Regression Model
We now estimate the least squares regression line:
$$
\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X
$$

Based on the sample of 13 students, the slope and intercept are calculated using the formulas:
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \dfrac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}, \quad 
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{X}
$$

### Putting It All Together
1. Plot the data to visualize the relationship.
2. Test the linear correlation coefficient.
3. Reject $H_0$ if $\rho = 0$ is not supported (significant correlation). The slope ($\hat{\beta}_1$) is also significantly different from zero.
4. Calculate and interpret regression coefficients.
5. Use the regression model for predictions within the valid range.
