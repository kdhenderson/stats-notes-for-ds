## ANOVA: Analysis of Variance

- **Purpose**: Test equality of means from more than two populations by comparing variability within groups to variability between groups.
- **Assumptions**:
  - All populations have normal distributions (reasonable symmetry in samples).
  - Population standard deviations are equal (to ensure differences in means aren't confounded by differences in variability).
  - Independence within (achieved automatically with random samples) and between samples.
- **Hypotheses**:
  - $H_0$: All population means are equal.
  - $H_A$: At least one population mean differs from another.
- ANOVA is a preliminary test; if significant, it indicates that at least one mean differs. Specific pairwise differences can be explored using post-hoc tests (not covered in detail here).

### Comparing Models in ANOVA
- **Two competing models**:
  - **Equal means model (EMM)**: Assumes all groups share the same population mean (null hypothesis).
  - **Separate means model (SMM)**: Assumes each group has its own mean (alternative hypothesis).
- **Hypotheses**:
  - $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$ 
  - $H_A$: At least one pair of means differs
- A **residual** is defined as: $\text{  Residual} = \text{Observed} - \text{Predicted}$

![**Equal Means vs. Separate Means Models.**

Brackets illustrate residuals from observed values to the grand mean.](images/fch06_equal_and_separate_means_models.png){fig-title=""}

#### Equal Means Model (EMM)
- All observations are predicted using the grand mean: $\bar{X} = 13$
- Sum of squared residuals (SSR): $\text{SSR}_{\text{EMM}} = 462$

| Level | Observation 1    | Observation 2    | Observation 3    |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1     | $(3 - 13)^2 = 100$ | $(5 - 13)^2 = 64$  | $(7 - 13)^2 = 36$  |
| 2     | $(10 - 13)^2 = 9$  | $(12 - 13)^2 = 1$  | $(14 - 13)^2 = 1$  |
| 3     | $(20 - 13)^2 = 49$ | $(22 - 13)^2 = 81$ | $(24 - 13)^2 = 121$ |

#### Separate Means Model (SMM)
- Each group has its own sample mean (perfect fit).
- Sum of squared residuals: $\text{SSR}_{\text{SMM}} = 24$

| Level | Observation 1    | Observation 2    | Observation 3    |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1     | $(3 - 5)^2 = 4$   | $(5 - 5)^2 = 0$   | $(7 - 5)^2 = 4$   |
| 2     | $(10 - 12)^2 = 4$ | $(12 - 12)^2 = 0$ | $(14 - 12)^2 = 4$ |
| 3     | $(20 - 22)^2 = 4$ | $(22 - 22)^2 = 0$ | $(24 - 22)^2 = 4$ |

#### Notes
- A perfect fit means predicted values match the observations exactly, so residuals are zero.
- The **sum of squared residuals (SSR)** quantifies total error:
$$
\text{SSR} = \sum (\text{Observed} - \text{Predicted})^2 = \sum (\text{Residual})^2
$$

### Comparing EMM and SMM Using an $F$-Test

To formally compare the equal means model (EMM) and separate means model (SMM), we use an **$F$-test**. This test evaluates whether the extra parameters in the more complex model (SMM) explain a significantly greater portion of the total variability.

See the ANOVA table below for how these calculations break down.

#### ANOVA Table

| Source | df | SS  | MS  | F     | P       |
|--------|----|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| Model (Between / Extra) | 2  | 438 | 219 | 54.75 | 0.0001 |
| Error (Within / Full / SMM)    | 6  | 24  | 4   |       |         |
| Total (Reduced / EMM)             | 8  | 462 |     |       |         |

- **df**: Degrees of freedom
- **SS**: Sum of squares
- **MS**: Mean square = SS / df
- **F**: Ratio of explained to unexplained variability: $F$-statistic = $\frac{\text{MS}_{\text{model}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{error}}}$
- **P**: $p$-value from the $F$-distribution

#### Notes
- Degrees of freedom reflect how many means are being estimated.
- Mean square values (MS) are variances: $\text{MS} = \frac{\text{SS}}{\text{df}}$, which follows the general variance formula: $\text{var}(x) = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n - 1}$
- The top row of the table (Between / Extra) is how much variance is explained by using separate means.
- The **mean square error (MSE)** estimates within-group variance: $\text{MSE} = 4$
- The **root mean square error (RMSE)** is:$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$
- This is also our estimate of the shared population standard deviation: $\hat{\sigma} = \text{RMSE} = 2$

#### Understanding Degrees of Freedom in ANOVA
- Degrees of freedom reflect how many parameters (means) are estimated and how much data is available to estimate variability.
- In ANOVA, the total degrees of freedom are split into two parts:

| **Source**              | **Formula** | **Interpretation**                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Model (Between Groups)  | $k - 1$     | Number of group means (parameters) being estimated minus 1 |
| Error (Within Groups)   | $n - k$     | Leftover variation after estimating $k$ group means      |
| Total                   | $n - 1$     | Total variation in the dataset                           |

For example, with 3 groups and 9 total observations:

- Model df = $3 - 1 = 2$
- Error df = $9 - 3 = 6$
- Total df = $9 - 1 = 8$

#### Visualizing the $F$-Test

The $F$-statistic is compared to an $F$-distribution with 2 and 6 degrees of freedom. (Every $F$-distribution has 2 degrees of freedom.)

- $F_{2,6} = 54.75$
- Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$: $F_{2,6}^{*} \approx 5.14$
- The region to the right of 54.75 under the curve gives the $p$-value, which is very small ($p = 0.0001$), indicating strong evidence against the null model (EMM).

![**$F$-distribution.** Right-skewed $F_{2,6}$ distribution showing critical value (5.14), observed test statistic (54.75), and rejection region representing $p$-value (0.0001).](images/fch06_fdistribution.png){fig-title=""}

#### Interpretation
- The top row of the ANOVA table shows how much variability is explained by the model.
- The second row shows how much variability is left over (residual error).
- A high $F$-value means the SMM explains significantly more variability than the EMM.
- We conclude that at least one group mean differs significantly from the others.

See the summary figure below for a visual breakdown of how these components are computed and interpreted.

## ANOVA: Six-Step Hypothesis Test

1. **Define Hypotheses**:
   - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots$ (equal means model)
   - $H_A$: At least one pair of means is different
   - The null model assumes all observations are drawn from a single population with the same mean (grand mean).
   - The alternative allows group-specific distributions with different means (separate means model).
   - Models are compared using the sum of squared residuals: a good fitting model has smaller residuals (observed − predicted).
2. **Get Critical Value**:
   - From an $F$-distribution
   - Degrees of freedom: $df_1$ (model) and $df_2$ (error)
   - In R, use `qf(1 - alpha, df1, df2)` to find the critical value. (Use $1-\alpha$ for a R-tailed test.)
3. **Calculate $F$-Statistic**:
   $$
   F = \frac{\text{MS}_{\text{between}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{within}}}
     = \frac{\text{Extra SS} / \text{Extra df}}{\text{MSE}} 
     = \frac{\text{Variation Explained}}{\text{Variation Left to Explain}}
   $$
   where:
   - $\text{MS}_{\text{between}} = \frac{\text{Extra SS}}{\text{Extra df}}$
   - $\text{MS}_{\text{within}} = \text{MSE} = \frac{\text{Error SS}}{\text{Error df}}$
4. **Determine p-value**:
   - Compare the test statistic to the $F$ distribution.
   - If $F$-statistic is in the upper tail, $p$ will be small.
5. **Decision**:
   - Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$.
6. **Interpretation**:
   - Rejecting $H_0$ because of a significant result suggests at least one group mean differs.


## Key Metrics in ANOVA

### $R^2$: Coefficient of Determination
- $R^2 = \dfrac{\text{Explained Variation}}{\text{Total Variation}} = \dfrac{\text{Extra SS}}{\text{Total SS}}$
- Represents the proportion of total variance in the response that is explained by the model (i.e., group membership).
- $R$: Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values

### RMSE: Root Mean Square Error
- $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}} = \sqrt{\text{Unexplained Variation}}$
- Estimates the typical distance between observed and predicted values (i.e., the standard deviation of residuals).

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)
- A unitless measure of **relative variability** (standard deviation relative to the mean):
  $$
  \text{CV} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\text{Grand Mean}} \times 100 = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\bar{X}} \times 100 = \frac{\sqrt{\text{MSE}}}{\bar{X}} \times 100
  $$

### SAS ANOVA Output Summary

SAS provides the $R^2$, root MSE, and coefficient of variation in its ANOVA output. See the example output below for how these metrics are reported.

**Example SAS Output: ANOVA Summary**

| Source           | DF | Sum of Squares | Mean Square | F Value | Pr > F |
|------------------|----|----------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Model (Between / Extra) | 2  | 438.0 | 219.0 | 54.75 | 0.0001 |
| Error (SMM)            | 6  | 24.0  | 4.0   |       |        |
| Corrected Total (EMM) | 8  | 462.0 |       |       |        |

| R-Square | Coeff Var | Root MSE | Score Mean |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 0.948052 | 15.38462  | 2.0      | 13.0       |

**Calculations**:

- $R^2 = \dfrac{\text{Explained Variation}}{\text{Total Variation}} = \dfrac{\text{Extra SS}}{\text{Total SS}} = \frac{438}{462} \approx 0.948$
- $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}} = \sqrt{\text{Unexplained Variation}} = 2$
- $\bar{X}$: grand mean, the mean of all observations ($n$ = 9 in the example above)
- The **Score Mean** reported by SAS is the grand mean ($\bar{X} = 13$), the average of all observations across all groups.
- $\text{CV} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\bar{X}} \times 100 = \frac{2}{13} \times 100 \approx 15.38\%$

**Interpretation**:

- Extra sum of squares: variability explained by the full model (SMM)
- Total sum of squares: total variability (that could be explained)
- The model (group membership) explains 94.8% of the total variability in the response ($R^2 = 0.948$).
- RMSE = 2 indicates the estimated standard deviation of residuals, the typical size of the model residuals.
- CV ≈ 15.38% indicates moderate relative variability around the grand mean. This matches the SAS output: `Coeff Var = 15.38462`.

## ANOVA Assumptions and Robustness

### Assumptions
- **Normality**
  - Check with histograms, boxplots, and Q–Q plots.
  - ANOVA is fairly robust to non-normality, especially when sample sizes are large and equal across groups.
- **Equal Standard Deviations**:
  - This assumption is crucial for the validity of ANOVA and $F$-test results.
  - ANOVA is less robust to violations of this assumption compared to $t$-tests.
  - Confidence intervals depend on this assumption being met.
  - Confidence intervals are widest when the group with the largest standard deviation also has the largest sample size.
- **Independence**
  - Observations must be independent both within and between groups.
  - This is generally satisfied through random sampling or random assignment.


## Alternatives to Standard ANOVA

### Welch’s ANOVA
- A robust alternative to classical ANOVA when standard deviations are unequal.
- *Still assumes normality*.
- Adjusts the degrees of freedom lower to account for unequal variances.
- Output includes adjusted $F$-statistic and *p*-value.

### Kruskal–Wallis Test
- A **non-parametric alternative** to ANOVA that compares medians instead of means.
- Useful for **non-normal** or **skewed** distributions or small sample sizes.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Does not assume normality.
  - Robust to unequal variances.
  - Observations must be independent.
- The *p*-value is based on a chi-square distribution.

  groupmeans ... ;

```


## Random vs. Fixed Effects

### Fixed Effects
- Levels (e.g., groups or treatments) are *explicitly of interest* and not intended to generalize beyond the study or represent a larger population.
- Inference applies only to the levels included in the analysis.
- Common in controlled experiments with pre-defined groups or treatments.
- The model estimates a unique mean for each level.

### Random Effects
- Levels represent a *random sample* from a larger population of possible groups or conditions.
- The goal is to make inferences about the entire population of levels---not just those observed in the study. That is, even if you cannot sample every possible level, the levels in the study are meant to be representative of the population of interest.
- The model accounts for two sources of variation:
  - **Residual variance** (within-group variability): variance of each observation from the overall mean
  - **Random effect variance** (between-group variability): variance associated with the random effects
- Observations are nested within groups drawn at random.
- There is typically more error associated with random effects models.

### Statistical Considerations
- **Random effects models** include additional variability from the group-level random component. This increases standard errors but yields more conservative and generalizable inferences.
- **Fixed effects models** do not account for this extra group-level variability, which may lead to underestimated standard errors if used when random effects would be more appropriate.
- Choosing the wrong model type can increase the risk of **Type I** or **Type II errors**.

> In short:  
>
> - Use **fixed effects** when your levels (e.g., treatments) are all of interest and exhaust the population you care about.  
> - Use **random effects** when your levels are sampled from a larger population and you want to generalize your conclusions.


## Writing Up Results

ANOVA tests whether the **between-group variability** is significantly larger than the **within-group variability**, providing evidence that group means differ.

- The *$F$-test* indicates *whether* at least one group mean differs.
- It does *not* identify *which* specific means are different or *how* they differ.
- Additional procedures such as *post-hoc tests* are required to explore these questions of interest (QOIs).

### Steps for Writing Results
1. **State the research question**, experimental conditions, and context clearly.
2. **Describe the study design**, including how data were collected, sample sizes, and treatments or groups.
3. **Check and summarize assumptions**:
   - Use graphical tools (e.g., histograms, Q-Q plots, residual plots).
   - Note whether normality, equal variance, and independence were reasonable.
4. **Provide descriptive statistics** for each group.
5. **Report the ANOVA test results**:
   - Include the *$F$-statistic*, degrees of freedom, *$p$-value*, and relevant effect sizes (e.g., *$R^2$*, RMSE, CV).
6. **Include residual diagnostics**:
   - Mention if any transformations were applied.
   - Note any violations and how they were addressed (e.g., using Welch’s ANOVA).
7. **Interpret the results in context**:
   - Discuss whether the null hypothesis was rejected.
   - Relate the findings to the original research question.
