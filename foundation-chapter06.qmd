- Calculate the sample size necessary to detect a particular effect size in ANOVA.
- Make statistical inferences for multiple samples and interpret results in context.
- Apply the extra sum of squares principle to create and interpret ANOVA tables.

- Understand the Kruskal-Wallis test as a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA.
- Differentiate between random and fixed effects.


## ANOVA: Analysis of Variance
- **Purpose**: Test equality of means from more than two populations by comparing variability within groups to variability between groups.
- **Assumptions**:
  - All populations have normal distributions (reasonable symmetry in samples).
  - Population standard deviations are equal (to ensure differences in means aren't confounded by differences in variability).
  - Independence within (achieved automatically with random samples) and between samples.
- **Hypotheses**:
  - $H_0$: All population means are equal.
  - $H_A$: At least one population mean differs from another.
- ANOVA is a preliminary test; subsequent post-hoc tests identify which means differ.

## ANOVA: 6-step hypothesis test
1. **Define Hypotheses**:
   - $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots$ (Equal means model).
   - $H_A$: At least one pair of means is different.
   - Null assumes data come from the same distribution (grand mean); alternative assumes different distributions (separate means).
   - Models are compared by finding the sum of squared residuals. A good fitting model will have smaller residuals (observed - predicted).  
2. **Get Critical Value**:
   - From an $F$-distribution.
   - Degrees of freedom: $df_1$ (model) and $df_2$ (error).
   - Calculate quantiles in R using `qf(alpha, df1, df2)`. Use $1-\alpha$ for a R-tailed test.  
3. **Calculate $F$-Statistic** (F in SAS ANOVA table):
   - Formula:  
     $F = \frac{\text{MS between}}{\text{MS within}} = \frac{\frac{\text{extra SS}}{\text{extra df}}}{\text{MSE}} = \frac{\text{Variation explained by the full model}}{\text{Variation left to be explained}}$.
   - Where:
     - $\text{MS between} = \frac{\text{extra SS}}{\text{extra df}}$
     - $\text{MS within} = \text{MSE} = \frac{\text{Error SS}}{\text{Error df}}$
4. **Determine p-value**:
   - Compare $F$-statistic to the critical value.
5. **Decision**:
   - Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value < $\alpha$; otherwise, fail to reject.
6. **Interpretation**:
   - Rejecting $H_0$ indicates evidence that at least one pair of group means is different.

## SAS code for ANOVA
```{sas eval=FALSE}
* Generalized Linear Model: Extends analysis to multiple groups (e.g. ANOVA for 3+ groups);
proc glm data = dataSet;
class group;
model responseVar = groupingVar; * Fits an ANOVA;
run;
```


## R code for ANOVA
```{r eval=FALSE}
# aov = analysis of variance
# numerical response ~ factor groupings
fit = aov(responseVar ~ groupingVar, data = dataSet)
summary(fit)
```


## Key Metrics in ANOVA

### $R^2$: Coefficient of Determination
- $R^2 = \frac{\text{Variation Explained by Full Model}}{\text{Total Variation}} = \frac{\text{Extra Sum of Squares}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares}}$. 
- Represents the percentage of total variance explained by group membership.
- Example: $R^2$ of 0.75 indicates 75% of the response variation is explained by group differences.
- $R$: Correlation coefficient

### RMSE: Root Mean Square Error
- $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}} = \sqrt{\text{Unexplained Variation}}$
- Quantifies the amount of unexplained variation in the model.

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)
$\text{CV} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\text{Grand Mean}} \times 100$
- Measures relative standard deviation as a percentage of the mean.


## ANOVA Assumptions and Robustness
- **Normality**:
  - Check with histograms, boxplots, and Q-Q plots.
  - ANOVA is robust to slight violations of normality, especially with large sample sizes.
- **Equal Standard Deviations**:
  - This assumption is crucial for the validity of ANOVA results.
  - ANOVA is less robust to violations of this assumption compared to $t$-tests.
  - Confidence intervals depend on this assumption being met.
  - Confidence intervals are widest when the group with the largest standard deviation also has the largest sample size.
- **Independence**:
  - Ensure independence of observations both within and between groups.  


## Welch’s ANOVA
- Still assumes normality.
- Adjusts for unequal standard deviations.
- Degrees of freedom are lowered.


## Kruskal-Wallis Test
- Non-parametric alternative for ANOVA.
- Tests medians instead of means.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Does not require normality, making it useful for non-symmetric distributions or small sample sizes.  
  - Robust to unequal variances.
- $p$-values follow a chi-square distribution.

## Random vs. Fixed Effects
- **Random Effects**:
  - Observations are a random sample from a larger population of possible levels.
  - Levels of observations are meant to be representative of the population of things you could sample, even if you cannot sample every possible level.
  - Desired inferences are on the entire population of levels, not just the levels included in the study.
  - Variance includes:
    - Residual variance (variance of each observation from the overall mean).
    - Variance associated with random effects.
  - There is typically more error associated with random effects models.
- **Fixed Effects**:
  - Inferences are specific to the levels included in the study.
  - Levels are not intended to represent a larger population.
- **Statistical Considerations**:
  - Random effects models account for extra variability by including variance from random effects, reducing the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors.
  - Fixed effects models do not include this extra variability, which may lead to increased risk of Type I or II errors if used improperly.


## Writing Up Results
- ANOVA tests whether the between-group variability is significantly larger than the within-group variability, providing evidence that group means are different.
- The $F$-test does not identify which specific means are different or how they differ. Additional tests (e.g. post-hoc tests) are required to answer these questions of interest (QOI).

### Steps for Writing Results:
1. State the research question, treatments, and context.
2. Describe data collection methods, sample sizes, and treatments.
3. Summarize assumption checks (relying on visual evidence).
4. Provide descriptive statistics for groups.
5. Report effect size, $F$-statistic, degrees of freedom, and $p$-value.
6. Include residual diagnostics, mention transformations and information about other tests if used.  
7. Conclude with decisions and contextual interpretations.
