## 1. Data Import & Summary Statistics

> Most SAS procedures require your dataset to be sorted by group for grouped analysis or plotting.
> You can either import data from a file or create a dataset manually for small examples.

### 1A. Import or Create a Dataset
```{sas}

/* OPTION 1: Import a CSV from your SAS Studio home directory */

%web_drop_table(WORK.mydata);

filename reffile '/home/your-username/path-to-your-data.csv';

proc import datafile=reffile
    dbms=csv
    out=WORK.mydata
    replace;
    getnames=yes;
run;

/* View structure and preview the dataset */
proc contents data=WORK.mydata;
run;

%web_open_table(WORK.mydata);
    
    
/* OPTION 2: Manually create a small dataset column-wise (each row = one observation) */

data mydata;
    input variable1 variable2;
    datalines;
    1 A
    2 B
    3 C
    4 D
    5 E
    ;
run;

proc print data = mydata;
run;


/* OPTION 3: Create a row-wise dataset (data entered horizontally using @@) */
data mydata;
    input variable @@;
    datalines;
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    ;
run;
    
proc print data = mydata;
run;
    
```

### 1B. Summary View & Sorting
```{sas}

/* Preview the data */
proc print data = dataset;
run;

/* Sort data by explanatory variable (required for some procedures) */
proc sort data = dataset;
    by explanatory;
run;

```

### 1C. Summary Statistics
```{sas}

/* Summary stats: n, mean, sd, min, max */
proc means data = dataset;
    var response;
run;

/* Medians by group */
proc means data = dataset median;
    class explanatory;
    var response;
run;

/* Manual p-value from t-statistic (two-sided) */
data mypval;
    pv = 2 * (1 - cdf("t", tstat, df));
run;
proc print data = mypval;
run;

```

### 1D. Log Transformation & Filtering
```{sas}

/* Create a log-transformed version of response */
data ldataset;
    set dataset;
    logResponse = log(response);
run;

/* Remove outlier (e.g., filter response < 1200) */
data datasetNoOutlier;
    set dataset;
    where response < 1200;
run;

/* Scatter plot without outlier */
proc sgplot data = datasetNoOutlier;
    scatter x = explanatory y = response;
run;

```

### 1E. Categorical Recoding & Viewing Subsets
```{sas}

/* Create ordinal version of categorical variable */

data educMultiGrp;
    set educMultiGrp;
    if Educ = '<12' then EO = 1;
    else if Educ = '12' then EO = 2;
    else if Educ = '13-15' then EO = 3;
    else if Educ = '16' then EO = 4;
    else if Educ = '>16' then EO = 5;
run;

/* Create a column to collapse levels */
data educMultiGrp;
    set educMultiGrp;
    if Educ = "<12" then Combine = "<12";
    else if Educ = "12" then Combine = "12";
    else if Educ = "13-15" then Combine = "13-15";
    else if Educ in ("16", ">16") then Combine = "16+";
run;

/* View first 50 rows of a dataset */
proc print data = lIncome5Grps(obs=50);
run;

```


## 2. Visualization & Assumption Checks

> Use `proc univariate`, `proc sgplot`, and `proc ttest` to visualize distributions and assess assumptions of normality and variance.  
> Many visualizations require sorting your dataset by the grouping variable.

### 2A. Univariate Plots (No Grouping)
```{sas}

/* Histogram and QQ plot (ungrouped) */
proc univariate data = dataset;
    var response;
    histogram response;
    qqplot response;
run;

/* Boxplot (ungrouped) */
proc sgplot data = dataset;
    vbox response;
run;

/* Scatterplot of response vs explanatory */
proc sgplot data = dataset;
    scatter x = explanatory y = response;
    * title "Scatterplot of ";
run;

/* Turn off the title */
title;
run;

```

### 2B. Histograms and QQ Plots by Group
```{sas}

/* Sort by grouping variable (required for BY statement) */
proc sort data = dataset;
    by explanatory;
run;
proc print data = dataset;
run;

/* Histograms grouped by explanatory */
proc univariate data = dataset;
    by explanatory;
    histogram response;
run;

/* QQ plots grouped by explanatory */
proc univariate data = dataset;
    * title "QQ Plot by ";
    by explanatory;
    qqplot response / normal(mu=est sigma=est);
run;


proc sgplot data = dataset;
	* title "Histogram by ";
    by explanatory;
    histogram response / transparency=0.5;
    density response; * with a normal distribution curve;
run;

```

### 2C. Boxplots and Density Plots by Group
```{sas}

/* Boxplot by group */
proc sgplot data=dataset;
    * title "Boxplot of";
    vbox response / category=explanatory;
run;

/* Histogram with overlaid normal curve by group */
proc sgplot data = dataset;
    by explanatory;
    histogram response / transparency = 0.5;
    density response;  /* Normal curve */
run;

```

### 2D. Visualizations from proc ttest
```{sas}

/* `proc ttest` also generates histogram, QQ plot, and boxplot (grouped) */
proc ttest data = dataset;
    class explanatory;
    var response;
run;

```

### 2E. Custom Histogram with Set Bin Width
```{sas}

/* Adjust histogram range and bin width */
proc univariate data = dataset noprint;
    by explanatory;
    histogram response / endpoints = 0 to 1000 by 50 normal; /* Adjust as needed */
    inset n mean std / pos = ne;
run;

```


## 3. Permutation Test

### 3A. Observed Difference in Means
```{sas}

/* Use proc ttest to compute observed difference between groups */
proc ttest data = dataset;
    class group;
    var response;
run;

```

### 3B. Generate Permutations with proc iml
```{sas}

/* Shuffle response values across group labels using IML */

/* Borrowed code from internet: randomizes observations and creates a matrix with one row per permutation */

/* NOTE: Replace `dataset`, `group` and `response` with your actual variable names */

proc iml;
    use dataset;
    read all var {group response} into x;  /* Make sure to specify class variable first */
    
      nPerms = 10000;                 /* Number of permutations */
    permuted = t(ranperm(x[,2], nPerms));  /* Create permuted response matrix */
    combined = x[,1] || permuted;   /* Combine original group column with each permuted column */

    create newds from combined;
    append from combined;
quit;

```

### 3C. Build Permutation Distribution
```{sas}

/* Use proc ttest to calculate mean differences for each permutation */

ods output off;
ods exclude all;   /* Suppress output */
  
/* The ods output line below is optional if you want to capture confidence intervals */
/* ods output conflimits=diff; */

proc ttest data = newds plots = none;
    class col1;
    var col2 - col10001;
run;

ods output on;
ods exclude none;

```

### 3D. Plot Permutation Histogram & Calculate p-value
```{sas}
                                                                    
/* Plot the distribution of permuted mean differences (Pooled method only) */
proc univariate data = diff;
    where method = "Pooled";
    var mean;
    histogram mean;
run;

/* Count number of permuted differences as or more extreme than observed */
/* Replace `obsDiff` with your observed test statistic from 3A */
/* Adjust for one-tailed or two-tailed test accordingly */
data numdiffs;
    set diff;
    where method = "Pooled";
    if abs(mean) >= abs(obsDiff);
run;

/* Print matching rows (just for visual check) */
proc print data = numdiffs;
    where method = "Pooled";
run;    

/* Manual Step:
   - Check the number of rows in `numdiffs` (from the log or output)
   - Divide that by the total number of permutations (e.g., 10000)
   - This gives your p-value */

```


## 4. $t$-Tests and Power Analysis

> This section includes basic $t$-test syntax, F-tests for equal variances, and power analysis using `proc power`.

### 4A. Basic $t$-Tests and Critical Values
```{sas}

/* Compute critical t-value for two-sided test at α = 0.05 */
data criticalvalue;
    critval = quantile("T", 0.975, df);
run;
proc print data = criticalvalue;
run;

/* One-sample t-test (H0: mean = muUnderNull) */
/* * proc ttest outputs histogram, boxplot and qqplot */
proc ttest data = dataset h0 = muUnderNull sides = 2 alpha = 0.05;
    var response;
run;

/* Paired t-test (H0: mean difference = 0, computed as Group2 - Group1) */
proc ttest data = dataset;
    paired explanatory2*explanatory1;
run;

/* Two-sample t-test (equal variance and Welch's handled together) */
/* Pooled uses pooled st.dev. and Satterthwaite uses Welch's */
proc ttest data = dataset h0 = 0 sides = 2 alpha = 0.05;
    class explanatory;
    var response;
run;

```

### 4B. Equality of Variances Tests
```{sas}

/* F-test for equality of variances is run automatically as part of proc ttest */
/* The F-test (default in proc ttest) assumes normal distributions. It's useful as secondary evidence for variance equality if visuals are inconclusive. Null: population variances are equal. */

/* Brown-Forsythe test does not require normality assumptions */
proc glm data = dataset;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / hovtest = bf;  /* Brown-Forsythe test */
run;  

```

### 4C. Power Analysis (One- and Two-Sample)
```{sas}

/* Power for one-sample t-test */
proc power;
    onesamplemeans
        sides = 1
        alpha = 0.05
        nullmean = 0
        mean = xbar

        alpha = 0.05
        meandiff = effectSize
        stddev = s
        npergroup = n1
        power = .; /* specify a dot or omit this line to solve for the unknown parameter */

run;

/* Example: specify total sample size and mean for each using `nullmean and meandiff` */
proc power;
    twosamplemeans
        sides = 1
        alpha = 0.05
        nulldiff = 0
        meandiff = 3
        stddev = 4.5
        ntotal = 47;  /* e.g. 24 in group 1, 23 in group 2 */
run;

```

### 4D. Power Curve Plots
```{sas}

/* Power vs. sample size (one-sample) */
ods graphics on;

proc power;
    onesamplemeans
        sides = 1
        alpha = 0.05

        power = .;
    plot x = effect min = 3 max = 5;
run;

ods graphics off;
		
```


## 5. ANOVA and Extra Sum of Squares

> This section includes one-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons, linear contrasts, and extra sum of squares tests for nested or grouped comparisons.

### 5A. One-Way ANOVA with Variance Checks
```{sas}

/* One-way ANOVA: for EMM and SMM (full), tests if any group means differ (i.e. any pair has difference of means) */
/* Brown-Forsythe test is included to check equal variance assumption (does not require normality) */
proc glm data = dataset;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / hovtest = bf;  /* Brown-Forsythe test (homogeneity of variance) */
run;

/* Manually compute F critical value */
data critical_value;
    set calculations;
    critical_value = finv(1 - alpha, dfn, dfd);  /* right-tailed (1-alpha) */
run;

```


### 5B. Multiple Comparisons (Tukey + Pairwise Tests)

    class Sport;
    model Height = Sport;
    means Sport / hovtest = bf;
    lsmeans Sport / pdiff adjust = tukey cl;
run;

/* Optionally show differences both directions (A–B and B–A) */
proc glm data = playersHeight;
    class Sport;
    model Height = Sport;
    means Sport / hovtest = bf tukey cldiff;
run;

/* The cl option provides CIs for the means, 
 while cldiff provides CIs for the differences between means. */

```


### 5C. Linear Contrasts
```{sas}
/* LINEAR CONTRASTS (on sum and avg) */
/* QOI 3: Create a contrast to test to see if there is evidence that
the mean height of group1 is significantly different than
the average of the mean heights of the other 4 groups
(as an alternative to the extra sum of squares test). */

/* Test linear contrasts using CONTRAST and ESTIMATE */
/* These compare one group mean to a linear combination of others */

/* didn't state order = data so groups are in alphabetical order;
order = data; keeps the data in the order it came in: proc glm data = Handicap order = data;
contrast gives you the sum of squares
estimate gives you the estimate of the gamma */  
  
proc glm data = dataset;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory;

    /* Grp1 vs sum or average of others (assuming 5 groups) */
    contrast 'Grp1 vs Sum of Other 4 Groups' explanatory 4 -1 -1 -1 -1;

data quantile;
    quant = quantile("t", 0.975, df=n-groups);
run;
proc print data = quantile;
run;

```

### 5D. Bonferroni Adjustment for Selected Comparisons
```{sas}

/* Simultaneous CIs for selected differences (e.g. μ2–μ3, μ2–μ5, μ3–μ5) */
/* k=3 (comparing 3 pairs) */

proc glm data = dataset order = data;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory;
    lsmeans explanatory / pdiff cl;

    /* ESTIMATE used to extract estimate and SEs for CI construction */

    estimate 'mu2 - mu5' explanatory 0 1 0 0 -1;
    estimate 'mu3 - mu5' explanatory 0 0 1 0 -1;

run;
proc print data = quantile;
run;

```

### 5E. Summary: Choosing a Multiple Comparison Adjustment

- When deciding multiple comparison correction:
  - Were the comparisons planned before looking at the data or unplanned? If planned, no need to make multiple comparison correction. Can use LSD.
  - Are the groups being compared to a single control or reference group? If so, use Dunnett’s.
  - Are the groups normally distributed with equal standard deviation? If so, use Tukey-Kramer.
  - If we are doing some or all unplanned pairwise comparisons, without a reference/control group and without the assumption of normality or equal variance, use Bonferroni.
```{sas}

/* Commands for various multiple comparison methods */

* LSD (Least Significant Difference, use when comparisons are planned) with CI half-width;
proc glm data = dataset order = data;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / lsd;  * means returns the half-width;
    lsmeans explanatory / pdiff cl;
run;

* Dunnett (compare each group to a control/reference group);
proc glm data = dataset order = data;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / dunnett('Control');
    lsmeans explanatory / pdiff = control('Control') adjust = dunnett cl;
run;  
/* Calculate the half-widths: HalfWidth = (UpperCL - LowerCL) / 2 */

* Tukey-Kramer (assumes normality + equal variance; unplanned all-pairwise) with CI half-width;
proc glm data = dataset order = data;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / tukey;
    lsmeans explanatory / pdiff adjust = tukey cl;
run;

* Bonferroni (safest if assumptions are not met or comparisons are partially unplanned) with CI half-width;
proc glm data = dataset order = data;
    class explanatory;
    model response = explanatory;
    means explanatory / bon;
    lsmeans explanatory / pdiff adjust = bon cl;
run;

* View all options together (Jaren’s code);
