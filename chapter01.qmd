# Drawing Statistical Conclusions


## Observational Studies vs. Experiments
- **Experiment:** The investigator actively manipulates the environment with random assignment to treatment groups.
  - Randomization ensures groups are comparable across all potential confounding variables and removes researcher bias.
  - Enables cause-and-effect conclusions.
- **Observational Study:** The researcher is passive and observes without intervention.
  - Suitable for ethical or practical constraints.
  - Can build evidence for causation when combined with multiple studies and theoretical considerations, e.g. smoking causes lung cancer.


## Statistical Sampling
Random sampling uses chance to select a representative sample, allowing us to infer population characteristics. 

### Key Definitions:
- **Parameter:** Characteristic of a population.
- **Statistic:** Characteristic of a sample.
  
### Sampling Designs:
1. **Simple Random Sample**: Each individual has an equal chance of selection.
2. **Stratified Random Sample**: The population is divided into subgroups (e.g., gender), and random sampling is performed within each group.


## Ethics of gathering data
- Informed consent must be obtained from participants to ensure they are aware of the studyâ€™s purpose, procedures, and potential risks or benefits.
- The Institutional Review Board (IRB) evaluates the study to determine its appropriateness:  
  - Ensures the study minimizes risks and maximizes benefits.
  - Reviews the experimental design and statistical plan for ethical and scientific rigor.


## Measuring Uncertainty

### Hypothesis Testing

#### Key Concepts
1. **Hypotheses**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: Assumes no effect or difference (e.g., treatment means are equal).
     - Because treatment group assignment is random, we assume that if the treatment has no effect, the parameter means are equal across groups.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\))**: Suggests an effect or difference exists.
2. **Test Statistic**: Divides a sample estimate (e.g. difference in means) by a measure of variability (e.g. standard error).
   - Example: A t-statistic in a two-sample t-test.
3. **P-Value**: Probability of observing by random chance a result as extreme as the sample, assuming \(H_0\) is true. Calculated from the test statistic.
4. **Decision**: Compare the p-value to the significance level (\(\alpha\)). Under the assumption that the population means are equal, the result is either unlikely or not unlikely.
   - If \(p < \alpha\): Reject \(H_0\).
   - Otherwise: Fail to reject \(H_0\).
5. **Conclusion**: State the null and alternative hypotheses in plain language, reporting a p-value.
   - Observational studies use a fictitious chance model, using the same calculations but the conclusions are different because of the lack of randomization

#### General Principles
- Evidence is gathered by collecting a sample and analyzing differences in key metrics.
- If \(H_0\) is true, differences between sample means should be small. The p-value helps quantify "small".

#### Lottery Example
- Assumption (hypotheses): Bivin is playing fair.
- Evidence (test statistic): He won 10x in a row.
- Probability (p-value): The probability of winning 10x in a row if he is playing fair is very, very small.
- Decision: He is not playing fair. Reject the assumption.
- Conclusion: Since the probability of winning 10x in a row is very small if he is playing fair, then we will conclude that Bivin is cheating.


### Permutation Testing

- **Purpose**: Tests results against all possible randomizations to assess how unusual the observed result is.
  - Example: In an experiment, permutations represent all possible assignments of participants to treatment groups.
- **P-Value Calculation**: Count the number of permutations as extreme as the observed result, divided by the total permutations.
  - Example: If 10 out of 1,000 permutations are as extreme as the observed difference, the p-value is \(10 / 1,000 = 0.01\).


## Writing Up Results

- Results are typically communicated in writing, often for non-expert audiences.  
- **Include context about the experiment**, such as:  
  - What is the research question?  
  - What were the treatment groups?  
  - What was measured?  
- **Include descriptive statistics**, such as:  
  - Mean  
  - Standard deviation  
  - Outliers, along with possible explanations  
  - Important differences observed in the data  
- **State the p-value**:  
  - Does it support the null hypothesis?  
  - What does this imply in the context of the research?  
- **Mention challenges**, such as:  
  - Difficulties encountered during the study  
  - Confounding variables that might have influenced the results  
- **Clarify the scope of the study**:  
  - Can the results be generalized to the population of interest?  
  - Is the sample representative of the broader population?  
- Ensure the report **includes enough detail** for the study to be reproduced by other researchers.
